# CO2BLOCK: A tool for estimates of storage resource capacity in saline aquifers

CO2BLOCK provides the automatic estimate of the storage capacity of an aquifer. 

Users only need to open and modify the script "CO2BLOCK.m". There is no need to open or modify the other scripts, which is instead not recommended.

Please refer to the user guide for more detailed instructions. 
If you want to learn more about the theory behind CO2BLOCK, please refer to the following papers:
- De Simone and Krevor (2020) A tool for first order estimates and optimisation of dynamic storage resource capacity in saline aquifers”. under review in International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control.
